                    <p> Before I became a professional nappy changer, I played social basketball. As part of this commitment, I coordinated all the logistics including the collection of money. This meant some pretty hefty calculations! </p>

                        The creation of this app was inspired by a couple of things:
                        <ul>
                            <li> My goal of successfully creating a mobile app </li>
                            <li> Make my life easier.</li>

        <h3 class="title is-3 has-bottom-border">Problem</h3>
        <p>
            There were two types of players; permanent and casual.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Permanent players paid a portion of the court hire bond, and would evenly split the court hire fee at the end of the term. Casual players would pay a small fee on a weekly basis. Each casual member who attended and paid would be steadily reducing the total amount owed for the permanent members to split and pay at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to this evolving calculation, week after week players were asking for IOUs or forgetting to pay their fee. I wanted to keep track of these problematic people so I could get my lackeys to sort them out. ;)

            <p>
                At the time of developing this app, I was completing a Xamarin.Forms project in my workplace. I was keen to expand my understanding of this framework beyond what I was doing in my 9am-5pm role and saw this app as the perfect opportunity to achieve this.

            <h6 class="title is-6">.NET Web API</h6>
            <p>
                This was a really good way of getting myself more familiar on how .NET Web API works from scratch. It was good to see its functionality and potential in comparison to .NET MVC 5.
