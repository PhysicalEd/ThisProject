                <p> ITC, my previous employer had an internal CRM system written in Delphi as a desktop application. This was problematic due to compatibility issues with running the application on different platforms. </p>

            <h6 class="title is-6"> Nice introduction to C# .NET MVC </h6>
            <p>
                This was a good introduction to the .NET stack. My friend showed me the ropes and I think this has helped me transition into my first developer job.

            <h6 class="title is-6"> Change should be managed </h6>
            <p>
                No matter how cool or modern looking your application is, people tend to choose what they are used to over a new, fresh look. With the old desktop application written years prior, the application looked a little outdated. 
                Using Bootstrap in this project, we initially tried to make the UI a bit more modern by using different layouts. When we presented this, we were advised to make the layout as similar to the old application as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is definitely nothing wrong with this, at the end of the day, the customer is always right. It was a good reminder that change should always be managed to ensure that the client both gets what they want as well as directing them to new and fresh ideas.
