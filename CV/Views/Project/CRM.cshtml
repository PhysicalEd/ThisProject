                One of the biggest reason for creating this mobile app was to enhance my understanding further about Xamarin.Forms. I was in the middle of completing a Xamarin.Forms projects and I wanted to learn more about it to enhance my understanding.
                Building this app definitely served that purpose and I was able to

                This was a really good way of getting myself more familiar on how .NET Web API works from scratch. It was good to see its functionality and potential in comparison to .NET MVC 5.

            <p>
                The original purpose of this project was quite basic - find out who has paid for the casual sessions and calculate the total amount for permanent players at the end of the term.
                Realistically, I could have just created an Excel spreadsheet and it would have been done in a couple of hours. But where's the fun in that?
            </p>

            <p>
                I started thinking it would be nice to record the attendances so I implemented an attendance module. Then I started to think about how it would be cool to have the application automatically send out notifications to players. And then I got into thinking how it would be cool to integrate my other personal ideas into this app etc. etc. etc.
                I then realised that this is what they talk about when they say scope creep. Unfortunately, I didn't get to utilise my app since I stopped basketball altogether. I have every intention on finishing it.

                This was a good introduction to the .NET stack. My friend showed me the ropes and I think this has helped me transition into my first developer job.

            <p>
                No matter how cool or modern looking your application is, people tend to choose what they are used to over a new, fresh look. With the old desktop application written years prior, the application looked a little outdated. 
                Using Bootstrap in this project, we initially tried to make the UI a bit more modern by using different layouts. When we presented this, we were advised to make the layout as similar to the old application as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is definitely nothing wrong with this, at the end of the day, the customer is always right. It was a good reminder that change should always be managed to ensure that the client both gets what they want as well as directing them to new and fresh ideas.
